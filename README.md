# Dgmjr.Types

Contains a collection of useful types and type gnenerators, including many abstractions to mark someting with IHaveAName and so on. as well as a robust Enumerations framework complete wih a code generator that can turn Enums into Enmumeration `class`es, `record class`es, `struct`s, or `record struct`s.

It also contains the RegexDtoGenerator, which can turn a regex with named groups into a data structure with those grouos as the properties.
